Block Matrix Multiply
---------------------------
- Block matrix multiplication does have fewer cache misses.
- Converting from row major to block and multiplying causes too many cache misses.
- Was verified empirically.

Unrolled Matrix Multiplication
---------------------------
- Tried to unroll either a row or column in either of the inputs
- Does result in improve performance of small square matrices
- Does not always translate to tall or wide matrices
  * can be much slower than other orders
- Did not integrate into library because of added complexity

Combine matrix for DenseMatrix64
---------------------------
combine() is a function in SimpleMatrix that combines two matrices together and grows if needed.
No equivalent is directly provided in CommonOps since it is horribly memory inefficient.  Why
use DenseMatrix64 if you are going to do that.
