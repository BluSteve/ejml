For 0.14 Release
- cholesky accuracy

For DenseMatrix64F

- Block Householder
  * Apply to all QR Algorithm.  SVD first

- LU
  - block

- Least Squares Solver
  - Improve performance

- Iterative solver

- Cholesky
 * Improve stability

- QR
  * Block version
  * Replace col with tran variant of QR decomposition?
    - tran does not use a custom matrix format.
    - tran seems to be about 10% slower on small matrices.

- SVD
  - Use QR alg to speed up singular values on very tall matrices (pg 403)
  - Divide and conquer algorithm
  - An implementation that just finds zero singular values
  - Add option to overwrite input matrix

- Eigen decomposition
  - Add option to overwrite input matrix
  - Divide and conquer algorithm.

- Accurate version of symmetric eigenvalue for 2 by 2
  - SVD
  - SymmEig

- Unroll block matrix multiplication when full block.
- Fast Matrix Multiply
- hard code cholesky decomposition for small matrices

- Matrix Multiplication:
  - Finish vector vector multiply
  - Code generator for matrix vector ops
  - Add matrix vector multiply
  - Auto switch to all of above in CommonOps
