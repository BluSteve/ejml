For 0.13 Release
- Decide if unrolled matrix multiply should be added
- Modify original matrix for decompositions
  * Make that the default behavior but have friendly classes make a copy by default?
    - Easier to test?

Mult
 - Move bound checking to CommonOps - remove it from everywhere else
 - call unrolled operations

Unrolled Mult
  - auto code for tranA
  - auto code for tranAB
  - auto code for tranB
  - Unit test it all

For DenseMatrix64F

- Bidiagonal
  - Column major implementation for tall matrices.  useful for SVD

- LU
  - block

- Iterative solver

- SVD
  - make computation of U and V individually optional
  - Use QR alg to speed up singular values on very tall matrices
  - Divide and conquer algorithm
  - An implementation that just finds zero singular values
  - Add option to overwrite input matrix

- Eigen decomposition
  - Add option to overwrite input matrix
  - Divide and conquer algorithm.

- QR with column pivoting

- Accurate version of symmetric eigenvalue for 2 by 2
  - SVD
  - SymmEig

- Fast Matrix Multiply
- hard code cholesky decomposition for small matrices

- Matrix Multiplication:
  - Finish vector vector multiply
  - Code generator for matrix vector ops
  - Add matrix vector multiply
  - Auto switch to all of above in CommonOps


Issues:

- Non-symmetric (general case algorithm) has a problem with repeat eigenvalues.  When it tries
 to solve for them it applies the solver to a singular matrix.
