For 0.14 Release
- cholesky accuracy

For DenseMatrix64F

- Block Householder
  * Apply to all QR Algorithm.  SVD first

- LU
  - block

- Least Squares Solver
  - Improve performance

- Iterative solver

- Cholesky
 * Change scale by 1.0/max to div by max to improve stability
 * See SVN revision 105
 * it was reverted since division is slower than multiplication and there is no way to
   evaluate performance improvement

- QR
  * New QR that uses a regular transposed matrix.  Take advantage of better transpose.
  * Create straight forward QR and LQ factorings
  * Use factorings in decomposition algorithms for QR and LQ

- SVD
  - Use QR alg to speed up singular values on very tall matrices (pg 403)
  - Divide and conquer algorithm
  - An implementation that just finds zero singular values
  - Add option to overwrite input matrix

- Eigen decomposition
  - Add option to overwrite input matrix
  - Divide and conquer algorithm.

- Accurate version of symmetric eigenvalue for 2 by 2
  - SVD
  - SymmEig

- Fast Matrix Multiply
- hard code cholesky decomposition for small matrices

- Matrix Multiplication:
  - Finish vector vector multiply
  - Code generator for matrix vector ops
  - Add matrix vector multiply
  - Auto switch to all of above in CommonOps

CHANGE NULL INPUT PARADIGM
- two functions.  one that always declares the variable and one which always takes one for input
