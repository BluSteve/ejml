For 0.15 Release
- cholesky accuracy
  * hard coded cholesky inverse for small matrices
- Define LinearSolver.quality() better using condition number
  * approximate with normalized determinant of triangular matrix?

For DenseMatrix64F

- Block Householder
  * Apply to all QR Algorithm.  SVD first

- LU
  - block

- Least Squares Solver
  - Improve performance

- Linear Solver
  * Iterative
  * Add condition(), use Hager's method? pg 132
  * Put this new condition into NormOps since it should be much faster

- Cholesky
 * Improve stability

- QR
  * Block version
  * Replace col with tran variant of QR decomposition?
    - tran does not use a custom matrix format.
    - tran seems to be about 10% slower on small matrices.

- QR with column pivoting

- SVD
  - Use QR alg to speed up singular values on very tall matrices (pg 403)
  - Divide and conquer algorithm
  - An implementation that just finds zero singular values
  - Add option to overwrite input matrix

- Eigen decomposition
  - Add option to overwrite input matrix
  - Divide and conquer algorithm.

- Accurate version of symmetric eigenvalue for 2 by 2
  - SVD
  - SymmEig

- Unroll block matrix multiplication when full block.
- Fast Matrix Multiply
- hard code cholesky decomposition for small matrices

- Matrix Multiplication:
  - Try a variant on mult_aux that does the vector mult up to block size then goes down a row.
  - Finish vector vector multiply
  - Code generator for matrix vector ops
  - Add matrix vector multiply
  - Auto switch to all of above in CommonOps
