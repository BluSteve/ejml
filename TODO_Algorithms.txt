For 0.13 Release
- Modify original matrix for decompositions
  * Make that the default behavior but have friendly classes make a copy by default?
    - Easier to test?


For DenseMatrix64F

- LU
  - block

- Least Squares Solver
  - Improve performance

- Iterative solver

- SVD
  - Use QR alg to speed up singular values on very tall matrices
  - Divide and conquer algorithm
  - An implementation that just finds zero singular values
  - Add option to overwrite input matrix

- Eigen decomposition
  - Add option to overwrite input matrix
  - Divide and conquer algorithm.

- QR with column pivoting

- Accurate version of symmetric eigenvalue for 2 by 2
  - SVD
  - SymmEig

Issues:

- Non-symmetric (general case algorithm) has a problem with repeat eigenvalues.  When it tries
 to solve for them it applies the solver to a singular matrix.
