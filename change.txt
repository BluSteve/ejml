- Added PolynomialFit example code.
- Updated comments to reflect the addition of LinearSolvers
- Added MatrixIterator to provide another way of accessing elements inside a matrix
- Unrolled small matrix matrix multiplication
- Can just compute eigenvalues.
- Fixed an array index out of bounds error when computing general eigenvectors

----- Version 0.11

2010/04/07

- Updated LevenbergMarquardt example.
- Added the ability to save the old data in reshape() if the matrix grows in size.
- Added Kronecker product
- Added LinearSolverFactory
- Changed constructor in DenseMatrix64F so that var-args can be used.
- Can add random numbers to a matrix
- Added null space to SingularOps
- Added a function in SingularOps to rearrange the SVD such that the singular values are in descending order.

----- Version 0.10.1

2010/02/18

- Fixed a bug with large symmetric matrices where eigen pairs would be incorrectly associated with each other.
- Made the general eigenvalue decomposition algorithm less buggy.  It can now handle the case where
  eigenvalues appear in a different order the second time, but doesn't solve for repeat values correctly.

----- Version 0.10

2010/02/16

- fixed a LU pivot matrix bug
- SVD Implicit QR algorithm (much faster than old)
- Optimized rank1update for large matrices
- Various refactoring and other tweaks.

----- Version 0.9

2010/01/29

- Added the QR Algorithm for eigenvalue decomposition for Symmetric matrices.
- improved eigenvalue unit tests exposing some problems with generic EVD
- various refactoring

----- Version 0.8

2010/01/15

- Usability improvements
- Fixed matrix multiply switching rules for some of the operators
- Added automatic switching to matrix vector multiply to some operators in CommonOps
- More random matrices: orthonormal, orthogonal, normal span, and with specific singular values.
- More matrix norms, including induced norms and all the p vector norms.
- Eigenvalue decomposition for general matrices.
- More functions in EigenOps and preexisting ones improved
- LU now works for rectangular matrices
- LU now generates a pivot matrix (I guess it is really PLU)
- various refactoring

- Made decomposition and linear solver algorithms use lazy initialization.

----- Version 0.6

2009/10/26

- Added QR Decomposition
- Added Leibniz formula for determinants.
  * This required a permutation algorithm to be added also.
- Fixed various bugs
- Improved SimpleMatrix to make it more useful


----- Version 0.5

2009/9/19

- Added another type of matrix multiplication that creates a temporary column
  * This significant improved performance in some areas

----- Version 0.4

2009/9/5

- Added two more Cholesky decomposition algorithm; block and LDL.
- Moved significant magic numbers in to EjmlParamters to provide a central place for configuration.
- Various other refactorings and bug fixes.

----- Version 0.3

2009/8/27

- This is the initial public distribution.  Has most of the final functionality.
