 * This is a generic interface for computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.
 * Eigenvalues and eigenvectors have the following property:<br>
 * <br>
 * Av=&lambda;v<br>
 * <br>
 * where A is a square matrix and v is an eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue &lambda;.
 * </p>

 * In general, both eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be complex numbers.  For symmetric matrices the
 * eigenvalues and eigenvectors are always real numbers.  EJML does not support complex matrices but
 * it does have minimal support for complex numbers.  As a result complex eigenvalues are found, but only
 * the real eigenvectors are computed.
